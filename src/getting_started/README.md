# Getting Started

This guide explains how to configure and use the pipit keyboard.


## Learning Strategy


Print a copy of the cheatsheet that shows key positions. Go through lessons in the typing tutor to practice typing letters, numbers, and punctuation. As soon as possible, jump into doing real work using the keyboard. It will be slow at first, but that's the best way to improve.

Once you comfortably know the positions of every letter, start chording small words all at once by pressing every letter in the word at the same time: when you want to type `"the"`, line up your fingers over `t`,`h`, and `e` and press them together. If that gives you the wrong word, press `command_cycle_word` and see if that fixes it. Read the section on [words](../config/mappings/word.html) to learn more.
