# Modes

Use cases:
* standard typing with words
* gaming modes for specific games, w+a not a chord
* windows mode: change nothing but some shortcuts
* one-handed hotkey modes, for specific programs
* one-handed typing

## Configuring modes

Kmap files specify which chord you press to type each plain_key, macro, or command. 

If `use_words` is true, use this kmap to generate chords for all the words in the dictionary.


## Adding new modes

Must edit `Pipit.cpp`.
