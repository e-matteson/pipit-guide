# Types of mappings

There are four different types of mappings between chords and key sequences. Each is used for a different purpose and reacts differently when modifier chords are pressed at the same time.

Each mapping is given a unique name, like `key_a`, `mod_shift`, or `macro_email`. This name is used both when setting its key sequence (in `settings.yaml`) and setting its chord (in a `.kmap` file).

<!-- TODO should plain_modifier be a 5th type? -->
