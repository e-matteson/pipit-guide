# Types of mappings

There are five different types of mappings between chords and key sequences. Each is used for a different purpose and reacts differently when modifier chords are pressed at the same time.

<!--  TODO confusing because some names are implicit -->
<!-- Each mapping is given a unique name, like `key_a`, `mod_shift`, or `macro_save_as`. This name is used both when setting its key sequence (in `settings.yaml`) and setting its chord (in a `.kmap` file).  -->

<!-- TODO should plain_modifier be a 5th type? -->
