# Configuration

The general approach to configuration is:

1. Edit files in the `settings` folder.
2. Run the configuration tool.
3. Load the updated firmware onto the keyboard using the Arduino IDE.


Here are some examples of changes you might want to make.

* add new words to the dictionary
* add a macro that types out your email address
* add a new mode with a one-handed layout full of hotkeys for a drawing program
